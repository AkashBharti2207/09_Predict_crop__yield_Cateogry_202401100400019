üîç Project Brief ‚Äì Crop Yield Prediction
This project focuses on predicting crop yield categories‚Äîlow, medium, or high‚Äîbased on agricultural features such as soil quality, rainfall, and seed type. Using a dataset containing these attributes, a machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier) was trained to classify yield levels effectively.

The process included:

Data preprocessing, such as encoding categorical data.

Model training using Random Forest for robust classification.

Evaluation through accuracy and classification metrics.

While the model achieved moderate accuracy (45%), the results highlighted class imbalance and feature limitations, suggesting room for improvement with additional data and advanced models. This project showcases how machine learning can assist in agricultural decision-making.
